What’s Enum data type, when is it used? And name three common built-in enums used frequently?

Enum (Enumeration) Definition:
An enum is a value type in C# that allows you to define a set of named constants. It improves code readability and type safety by limiting variables to predefined values.

When to Use:
Enums are used when you have a collection of related constants, such as states, options, or categories, making the code more understandable and maintainable.

Three Common Built-in Enums:

ConsoleColor – Defines colors for text and background in the console.
DayOfWeek – Represents the days of the week.
FileAccess – Specifies access levels (Read, Write, ReadWrite) for file operations.
3. What are scenarios to use string vs StringBuilder?

Use string when:

You are working with small and infrequent modifications (e.g., a single concatenation).
The immutability of string provides safety, such as in multi-threaded applications.
Performance is not critical, like in one-time transformations or small-scale operations.
Use StringBuilder when:

You perform numerous modifications (e.g., appending, replacing, or inserting).
Optimizing performance for large-scale string operations is essential.
You need dynamic string construction (e.g., building log messages in a loop).
